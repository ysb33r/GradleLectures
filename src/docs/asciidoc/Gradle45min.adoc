Not just for building JVM projects

== Gradle DSL

* Underlying language is Groovy
* You don't need to be a Groovy expert to be a Gradle power user
* Groovy doesn't need `;` in most cases
* Groovy does more with less punctuation, making it an ideal choice for a DSL
* In most cases lines that do not end on an operator is considered a completed statement.

Call current Makefile from Gradle

[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
  id "org.ysb33r.gnumake" version "1.0.2"
}
import org.ysb33r.gradle.gnumake.GnuMakeBuild

task runMake (type:GnuMakeBuild) {
  targets 'build','install'
  flags  DESTDIR : '/copy/files/here', BUILD_NUMBER : '12345'
}
