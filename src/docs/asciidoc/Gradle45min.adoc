== Gradle DSL

* Underlying language is Groovy
* You don't need to be a Groovy expert to be a Gradle power user
* Groovy doesn't need `;` in most cases
* Groovy does more with less punctuation, making it an ideal choice for a DSL
* In most cases lines that do not end on an operator is considered a completed statement.
