Gradle is cool and it is cool because it is a next-generation build -and-deply tool breaking new ground.
It is the default build tool in the Android tool chain.
It is growing in popularity across JVM, .NET & native platforms.
Changes are good that you will have to deal with it some or other time in in the future.
The purpose of this labs session is to accelerate learning and help you get going with Gradle a lot quicker.

In this hands-on session we'll cover:

* Building Java projects
* The power of Copy, Jar & Zip tasks
* Building other JVM language projects
* Understanding source sets, configurations & extensions
* Lazy evaluation
* Minimal Groovy syntax
* Migrating from Maven & Ant

This should leave you with enough of an understanding to tackle more complex build projects of your own or to migrate your current build to more maintable, more-readable, Gradle-based build.

You will need a laptop with at least JDK7 installed and any source code editor (IntelliJ or Eclipse recommended).
