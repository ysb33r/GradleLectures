= Java Projects
:toc: right

Goto `exercises/jvm-java` and open the `build.gradle` file.

== Basics of a Java Project

Run `./gradlew tasks` and take notice of the list of tasks.

Now apply the `java` plugin.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{exercises}/jvm-java/solution.gradle[tags=javastart1]
----

Run `./gradlew tasks` again and note all of the main tasks that the plugin has added.
Run `./gradlew tasks -all` to see __all__ of the added tasks.

Repositories for dependencies are configured in a `repositories {}` block.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{exercises}/jvm-java/solution.gradle[tags=javastart2]
----

Dependencies are added in the `dependencies {}` block on a per-configuration basis.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{exercises}/jvm-java/solution.gradle[tags=javastart3]
----

Run `./gradlew dependencies` to see the configurations that were added by the `java` plugin
as well as the transitive dependencies.

== Obtaining test reports

Edit `examples/jvm-java/src/devoxxma/workshop/ExampleTest.java` and uncomment the
`thisOneWillFail` test.

Run `./gradlew test` and have a look at the output. Open the provided link in a browser.

== Building Java, Test with Spock

Because Spock Framework is awesome...


////
== First project

* *Workdir*: `examples/jvm-java-first`
* Open `build.gradle`
[source,groovy]
----
include::{snippets}/java.gradle[]
----
* Convention over configuration
* Intelligence provided by plugin

[source]
----
src -- main -- java
----

== Add some testing

* *Workdir*: `examples/jvm-java`
* Open `build.gradle`

== Gradle Dependency Management

* Easy to use
* Flexible to configure for exceptions
* Uses `dependencies` closure
* First word on line is usually name of a configuration.
** Configurations are usually supplied by plugins.
* Dependencies are downloaded from repositories
* Maven coordinates are used as format

== Gradle Repositories

* Specified within a `repositories` closure
* Processed in listed order to look for dependencies
* 'jcenter()` preferred open-source repo.
* `mavenLocal()`, `mavenCentral()`, `maven {}`
* Ivy repositories via `ivy {}`
* Flat-directory repositories via `flatDir`
