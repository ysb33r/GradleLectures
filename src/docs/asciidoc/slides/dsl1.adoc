* First word on line is usually name of a configuration.
** Configurations are usually supplied by plugins.
* Dependencies are downloaded from repositories
* Maven coordinates are used as format

=== Gradle Repositories

* Specified within a `repositories` closure
* Processed in listed order to look for dependencies
* `jcenter()` preferred open-source repo.
* `mavenLocal()`, `mavenCentral()`, `maven {}`
* Ivy repositories via `ivy {}`
* Flat-directory repositories via `flatDir`

== Gradle DSL

* Underlying language is Groovy
* You don't need to be a Groovy expert to be a Gradle power user
* Groovy doesn't need `;` in most cases
* Groovy does more with less punctuation, making it an ideal choice for a DSL
* In most cases lines that do not end on an operator is considered a completed statement.
