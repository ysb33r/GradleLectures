== Gradle Tasks : Configuration vs Action

* Use of `<< {}` adds action to be executed
** Tasks supplied by plugin will have default actions
* Use of `{}` configures a task

== Buildscript

* The `buildscript` closure is special
* It tells Gradle what to load into the classpath before evaluating the script itself.
* It also tells it where to look for those dependencies.
* Even though Gradle 2.1 has added a new way of adding external plugins, `buildscript` are
  much more flexible.

== Extensions

* Extensions are global configuration blocks added by plugins.
* Example: The `jruby-gradle-base` plugin will add a `jruby` block.
